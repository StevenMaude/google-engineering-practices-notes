# Notes from reading Google Engineering Practices documentation

This repository contains notes I made in Markdown format while reading
the [Google Engineering Practices
Documentation](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/).

Much of it is a verbatim, or near verbatim copy; other sections may have
been paraphrased slightly.

It's all in a single [Markdown document](NOTES.md) which is possibly
slightly easier to reference or review than the original document spread
across several pages.
